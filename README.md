# 3dp-price-calculator

This is a customizable calculator for 3d printing price. 

Take in mind it was originally intended for small businesses but could also be useful for unipersonal endeavours as well. 

It includes costs for:
- material consumption
- 3dprinter life expectancy
- the technician that slices/ postprocesses parts
- engineer hours for complex projects
- electricity (not yet implemented, in my case electricity is still cheap)

It also includes a margin ( = price - costs )  expressed as % of total price before taxes

And also final price with taxes. 


Backlog: 
- it would be great to integrate it as plugin to Bambu Studio / Ultimaker Cura.
- Even better to make all of it run online so customers can automatically get a presupuesto
- add electricity costs
- improve the estimation of time in pre / postprocessing
- add costs of packaging and logistics
- add a discount on quantity (beware of not appling too much of a discount as to loose money).
